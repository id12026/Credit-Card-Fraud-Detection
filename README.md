#Documentaion and Reporting:-

//Introduction
Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
Significance:

Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the financial industry to prevent financial losses and protect consumers. Developing an accurate and efficient model can significantly reduce the incidence of fraud.
Data Collection
Data Preprocessing
Loading the Dataset:

The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Basic information about the dataset, including the number of records, data types, and summary statistics, is displayed.

The dataset is checked for missing values.

The class distribution is visualized to understand the imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

Normalization or Standardization:

Features are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance using StandardScaler.
Feature Engineering
Feature Selection:

All features except the target variable ('Class') are selected.
Dimensionality Reduction:

PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space.
Model Selection
Algorithms Considered:

Several machine learning algorithms are considered for the task, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These models are chosen for their performance in classification tasks and their ability to handle imbalanced datasets.
Model Training
Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Training Models:

Each selected model is trained on the training data.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Randomized search is used to tune hyperparameters for the Random Forest model.
Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics:

The models are evaluated using classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC AUC scores.
Monitoring Performance:

Model performance is monitored by logging predictions and setting up alerts for model drift. This ensures the model remains accurate and reliable over time.
REPORTING:- From the using of different models we can observe that the accuracy is 99.95611109160492. From this we can observed we have selected the right machine learning model according to the objective.
