- Creating a machine learning model for Credit Card Fraud Detection.

Objective: Create a machine learning model to Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset.. This task will cover data preprocessing, pipeline creation, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

Steps to Follow:-

Here are the steps summarized without detailed explanations:

Step 1: Data Collection

Obtain a relevant dataset for credit card fraud detection. Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Load the dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Normalize or standardize the data.

Step 3: Feature Engineering

Select relevant features.

Apply dimensionality reduction techniques if necessary.

Step 4: Model Selection

Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms. Step 5: Model Training

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train the selected models.

Tune hyperparameters.

Step 6: Model Evaluation

Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

Implement cross-validation.

Step 7: Model Deployment

Save the trained model.

Deploy the model using a web framework.

Monitor model performance.

Step 8: Documentation and Reporting

Document the entire process.

Create reports and visualizations.
